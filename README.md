About chess

This java chess system runs through the terminal! 

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkerboard consisting of 64 squares of alternating colors. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is under attack and has no legal move to escape capture. 

At the beginning of a game, each player starts with 16 pieces, resulting in a total of 32 pieces on the board.The pieces have specific movement rules, and their positions can influence the game's outcome.
