## ♟️ Java Chess System

<p> <i> → This java chess system runs through the terminal! </i></p>

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkerboard consisting of 64 squares of alternating colors. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is under attack and has no legal move to escape capture. At the beginning of a game, each player starts with 16 pieces, resulting in a total of 32 pieces on the board.The pieces have specific movement rules, and their positions can influence the game's outcome.

### 🧠 How The Chess Pieces Move:

</br>

**King “K”**

Moves one square in any direction: vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
</br></br>

**Queen “Q”**

Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically: in other words, it can move in any direction for any number of squares.
</br></br>

**Rook “R”**

Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically: it can move in a straight line either horizontally or vertically for any number of squares.
</br></br>

**Bishop “B”**

Moves any number of squares diagonally: it can move in a straight line diagonally for any number of squares.
</br></br>

**Knight “N”**

Moves in an 'L-shape': it moves two squares in a straight direction (horizontally or vertically) and then one square perpendicular to that direction. The knight is the only chess piece that can jump over other pieces.
</br></br>

**Pawn “P”**

Moves one square forward: it can move one square straight forward towards the opponent's side of the board. 
</br>

- On its first move, a pawn can move two squares forward instead of one.
- Pawn captures diagonally: when capturing an opponent's piece, the pawn moves one square diagonally forward.

### 📖 Movements:

To move a piece you first need to select it, for that you type the column letter and row number of its position respectively.

For example, to move a pawn, you could enter the letter “d” (column d) and the number 2 (row 2). After that, the possibilities of moves will be highlighted on the board and it's up to you to type again the column letter and the line number of the position you want to move that piece.

**Note:** if you select something wrong or that restricts the game rules, one will be launched and an exception message will appear to the user.
