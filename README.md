<p> <i> → This java chess system runs through the terminal! </i></p>

Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkerboard consisting of 64 squares of alternating colors. The objective of chess is to checkmate the opponent's king. Checkmate occurs when the king is under attack and has no legal move to escape capture. At the beginning of a game, each player starts with 16 pieces, resulting in a total of 32 pieces on the board.The pieces have specific movement rules, and their positions can influence the game's outcome.

Moves one square in any direction: vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

Queen “Q”
Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically: in other words, it can move in any direction for any number of squares.

Rook “R”

Bishop “B”
Moves any number of squares diagonally: it can move in a straight line diagonally for any number of squares.

Knight “N”
